# Clustering artworks by visual qualities of uncertainty

With the open-ended character of this assignment ([see instructions here](https://github.com/visualizedata/ml/tree/master/ML_assignment_3/option_2)), I decided to try and cluster the artworks by the visual qualities of uncertainty they express, because the dataset was created with that intention and is unique in that way. I didn’t want to cluster the works by medium, genre or date since these seemed the more obvious criteria. Early exploration was rewarding, so I mainly experimented with the selection of variables and number of clusters.

In regards to the number of clusters, I settled between my minimum and maximum. With 20 clusters some visual similarities were exhaustive in some clusters, but others felt too broad. At the upper

Choosing variables, I excluded the boolean indicators ( [ – see the original description of the variables here](https://github.com/visualizedata/ml/blob/master/ML_assignment_3/option_2/contents-of-cluster_images.csv)). For example, whether an artwork was a map or representative, so the clustering would be restricted to the visual expressions only.

### Here’s an overview of the variables I used
| variable | explanation                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| or       | various orientations, ranging from the vertical to the horizontal in a distinct direction                                                                                                    |
| po       | A POINT represents a location on the plane that has no theoretical length or area. This signification is independent of the size and character of the mark which renders it visible.         |
| li       | A LINE signifies a phenomenon on the plane which has measurable length but no area. This signification is independent of the width and characteristics of the mark which renders it visible. |
| ar       | An AREA signifies something on the plane that has a measurable size. This signification applies to the entire area covered by the visible mark.                                              |

### Implementation

For the implementation I built on the starter code and what we discussed in class. I consulted the silhouette graphs – but also had the feeling that looking at the clusters would be the most helpful, so I tried to organize them on a website to allow for quick quality control and also making comments on clusters.
